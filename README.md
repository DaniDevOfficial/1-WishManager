**Project Idea: WishManager**

**Description:**
Create a basic task manager application using PHP, HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript. This application will allow users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks will be stored in a MySQL database.

**Features:**
1. User Registration and Authentication: Allow users to sign up for an account and log in securely.
2. Task Management:
   - Add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level.
   - View a list of tasks sorted by priority and due date.
   - Edit existing tasks to update their details.
   - Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
3. User Profile: Provide users with a profile page where they can view their tasks and update their account information.
4. Responsive Design: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.

**Technologies:**
- PHP: Backend scripting language for server-side logic and database interaction.
- MySQL: Database management system for storing user data and tasks.
- HTML/CSS: Frontend markup and styling for the user interface.
- JavaScript (optional): Add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the frontend.

**Steps to Implement:**
1. Set up a local development environment with Apache, PHP, MySQL, and a text editor or IDE of your choice.
2. Design the database schema for storing user accounts and tasks. Create tables for users and tasks with appropriate fields and relationships.
3. Implement user registration and authentication functionality using PHP sessions and MySQL database queries.
4. Develop the frontend interface using HTML and CSS. Use forms to collect task information from users and display task lists.
5. Write PHP scripts to handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
6. Implement user profile functionality to allow users to view and manage their tasks.
7. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected and handle edge cases gracefully.
8. Deploy the application to a web server if desired, or continue testing and refining it locally.
